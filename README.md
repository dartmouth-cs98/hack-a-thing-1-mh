### What I attempted to build 
I built a basic real time chat application. I thought this would be important for my (potential) idea because there would need to be communication between patients and doctors. Given the complex security concerns surrounding video (and the good existing alternative we pay so much for: zoom) I thought it would be interesting to build a chat app. I also thought that texting / messaging is one of the most common technology tools I use on a daily basis and that it'd be important to know how to build / how it would even work. 

Note that cool features include an "emoji converter" where you can type something like <3 and it'll turn into the heart emoji in the chat. The application will also scroll to bottom automatically. In order to talk with somebody, you need to be in the same "room" as they are in, so there is a room code you will need to enter. 

### Who did what (if you worked with someone else) 
I worked alone so I did everything myself. I didn't want a partner because I thought I'd get more out of the assignment that way. 

### Instructions for use
I'm not sure if this is necessary if you (the TA/ instructor) download from my github, but you will need to run 'npm install --save' the below for the following sections: 

* Server: corse, nodemon, express, socket.io
* Client: react-router, socket.io-client, react-scroll-to-bottom, react-emoji, query-string and react-router-dom (I had to hack it with this last one, not sure if this is a specific issue on my end)

### What you learned 
I learned a ton. Firstly, it was great to warm up to coding again. A lot of stuff I learned in CS52 in the spring was very "scary" and new and it felt very intimiating, but this time around, it didn't seem intimidating and felt more natural/fun/relaxed. Secondly, I took a deeper dive into hooks and really understood the topic better. CS52 first introduced the topic to me, but CS52 made intros to a lot of topics and I didn't happen to go deeply into hooks then. But I went deeply into hooks this time around and think I have a good preliminary understanding of them. 

### What didnâ€™t work
There were a ton more features I wanted to add so that this could be on par with iMessage or FB messenger or other professional messaging apps but I have to recruit for a full time job so not sure if that would've been a good idea. More specifically, I wanted to have reactions like the heart or thumbs up you can use in iMessage when you press and hold a text to express emotion. I think simply getting back into the coding groove was hard. I haven't coded since spring term and I realize that I've gotten a bit rusty so even getting warmed up / started again was hard. For example, I learned hooks in CS52 in the spring but it was near the end of the course and I did not dive as deeply into it as I did for this project (where I extensively used hooks). 


### Tutorial Disclaimer
I used a tutorial I found on youtube by JavaScript Mastery titled "Build and Deploy a Realtime Chat Application - Socket.io, Node.js, and React.js". Link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc


### Honor Code
I basically followed his tutorial on youtube. In the tutorial, he codes on-screen and explains why he is doing what he is doing. I essentially followed his directions/ actions step by step including the CSS styling. While the video is only ~2 hours, the overall assignment took my roughly 11 hours. This is not because I was slow at copying his code. Rather, I wanted to actually understand what was going on and paused the video to do research on topics he touched on. For example, I watched his entire hooks video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9M9CGSd69I&t=1936s) and practiced coding hooks as well, which took appx 4 of the 11 hours. But I also made a lot of stupid mistakes along the way (ie wrong brackets or parantheses) that took me a while to debug.
